# Guardian Technologies 
[Guardian Technologies](https://github.com/Guardian-Techonologies)
### Guardian Technologies was set up to provide blue team capabilities for an AWS infrastructure. Our main integration was Splunk Enterprise to provide a total SIEM solution. I configured a forwarder with specific logs to send login and network activity on both Windows and Linux Systems. I then created a Dashboard To display the results in panels that had drill-downs to navigate specific searches for login activity and potential unauthorized access. We also configured other avenues for log capabilities such as Cloudwatch/Cloudtrail, GuardDuty, and Lambda to send automatic alerts through SMTP for failed SSH attempts.

### Built AWS infrastructure utilizing VPC and VPN. Set up security groups with the concept of blacklisting, only allowing certain ports through to private and public servers depending on the security group associated with each EC2 instance. Made sure the Servers were CIS-compliant and focused on making the servers as secure as possible as the main goal.
